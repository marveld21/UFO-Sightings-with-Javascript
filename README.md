# UFO Sightings with Javascript
## Project Overview

We are designing a web application that will allow users to look through our UFO Sighting data.

## Results

### How to use filters
When visiting the site you will notice the Filter Search on the left side of screen. You may then fill in some or all of the blanks to initiate a search.

After applying filters hit enter and the filtered search will be shown on the right hand side.

To reset all filters click the UFO Sightings link at the top of the page.

## Summary

The site has an initial drawback with the search field in that it is case sensative. This causes confusion because normally proper nouns such as cities, states and countries should be capitalized.

We could also imporve the search feature by allowing wild cards or partial searches.We also need another filter for Duration. Perhaps one that is grouped by time buckets and shown as a dropdown filter.
